### **Key Visuals:**

**a.	Total Revenue, Total Units Sold, Week-Over-Week % change, and Month and Week Slicers**

Description: Cards display Total Revenue, Total Units Sold, and the percentage increase or decrease compared to the previous week. Slicers allow users to view these details for specific time periods. 

Insight: The insights include tracking weekly trends in revenue and units sold (increases or decreases) and summarizing monthly revenue and units sold for a quick overview. 

**b.	Revenue by Month**

Description: A Clustered Column chart showing the revenue by month. 

Insight: The highest revenue was achieved in January, followed by a gradual decline in the subsequent months, with slight increases observed in March and August. 
These fluctuations could be attributed to promotions or changes in consumer behavior.

**c.	Revenue by Product Category:**

Description: A Clustered Bar Chart displaying the revenue earned in each Product Category.

**d.	Revenue by Week Number:** 

Description: A line chart displaying the weekly revenue trend, highlighting patterns over time. Additionally, it can be used to forecast revenue for upcoming weeks based on data from previous weeks.

Insight: There are noticeable fluctuations in the weekly revenue generated. However, using this data, once the fluctuations are stabilized, we can forecast the revenue for the coming weeks with 99% confidence, which will aid in more effective supply and demand planning.

**e.	Revenue by Payment Method:**

## **3.	Key Findings**

-	The Highest Revenue generating Product Category is Electronics in North America followed by Home Appliances in Europe and then by Sports in Asia. 

-	There are noticeable fluctuations in the weekly revenue generated.

-	The pricing data across product categories is right-skewed, with the Mean Average Unit Price higher than the Median, suggesting that more expensive products are pulling the average price upward.

## **4.	Recommendations**

-	Increasing the Sample size of the Data would result in a more accurate and precise analysis and forecasts. Additionally, including the cost of each product will also give a clearer picture of which products are performing well in terms of both sales and profitability, helping to make more informed decisions.

-	Conduct a deeper analysis into the fluctuations in sales and revenue. Identifying the underlying causes, such as seasonal changes, promotions, or external factors, will help in developing strategies to stabilize these fluctuations and optimize revenue consistency.

-	Since Electronics is the highest revenue-generating product category, focusing on targeted promotions for these products in regions where their performance is lower could lead to increased revenue across all areas.

-	As, most revenue comes from Credit Card transactions, offering incentives such as discounts, loyalty rewards, or exclusive deals for credit card users can drive even more purchases and foster customer loyalty. This will enhance the perceived value of choosing your business and increase revenue.
